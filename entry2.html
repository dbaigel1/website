		Hi All!<br><br>

		The past few weeks have been the perfect way to get introduced to China. I went on a trip and explored more of the country, and I got my fair share of bodily sicknesses that seem like a rite of passage at this point for traveling to new places. This email will mostly cover my trip to Yunnan province as that’s what I’ve been up to recently. As always there will be a TLDR at the end if you have no interest in reading the email, but signed on to receive updates anyway… <br><br>


		Yunnan province is located in the very southwest of China, so basically directly west of where Will and I live in Shenzhen, and borders Myanmar. Our entire trip lasted about 10 days and included tons of trains of buses to get us to the far-off places we wanted to see. For example, our first morning we woke up at 5am (ick) and took a 1-hour metro ride to the train station where we boarded our first 8-hour bullet train to Kunming, the capital of Yunnan. We got off, took another 1-hour metro ride to the other side of the city, got some lunch, walked to a different train station and boarded an overnight train to get from Kunming to Lijiang. By the time we arrived in Lijiang at 6am, we had spent 25 hours traveling and celebrated by taking a 5-hour nap in our new temporary home. <br><br>

		Having never been on a bullet train before I found it pretty incredible. It reached a top speed of 300 km/h (which is almost 190 mph) and it passed through some spectacular landscapes of southwest China. The second train was an overnight train, where each person gets a room with two bunkbeds in it and three new friends to make. On top of that, they also had carts running up and down the aisles with snacks and drinks, which sort of reminded me of Harry Potter as long as you replace the chocolate frogs with cups of noodles.
		Will and I originally got split into different rooms, but a woman kindly switched with Will so that we could be together as the only two foreigners on the entire train. We were thankful until we all went to sleep and one of our new friends started snoring as if he was a trumpet player with no shame.<br><br>

		Lijiang is an amazing city. It’s known for its proximity to incredible nature, and the old town of Lijiang is actually famous as a UNESCO world heritage site. Unfortunately due to that and it being a really cool place it's riddled with tourists. Not international tourists, but rather Chinese tourists from different provinces. I previously thought that I was getting a lot of stares from people in Shenzhen, a tier 1 city, but I was not prepared for the attention I got in Lijiang. You could say the trip was almost defined by other people forcing interactions with us. People would come up to us on the street and take pictures with us, people would try to sneakily take pictures of us in restaurants, people would come up to us and ask us questions such as “what do you like to do?” or “do you like rice noodles?” probably just to practice their English. Initially, it felt like Will and I were some sort of royalty where everyone stared in wonder, but it quickly got tiring as it took an extra 10 minutes to get anywhere due to multiple photo shoots and interviews.<br></p>

		Walking around Lijiang on the first day we stumbled upon a Naxi dance ceremony. They, of course, ushered us to join them in the dance and afterward, a couple of the dancers proceeded to take us around their house telling us about the history of the Naxi ethnicity in China. After wandering around the town, we took our hostel owner’s advice and hiked up a mountain in order to gain free backdoor access to the “Black Dragon Pool” (which otherwise cost $12 USD to get in). The hike was apparently how all the locals got to the pool (which was really a pond) for free, though it was hard to imagine. The hike was relatively arduous, though I’m probably just super out of shape. At the pool itself, we walked through a garden where a group of musicians was rehearsing. A man stopped us and sat us down, poured us some tea and proceeded to talk to us, but really just Will, for an hour about the differences in cultures between China and the US. He was a professor of economics from a university in the area. While I couldn’t follow along with the majority of the conversation, he did equate the difference in Chinese culture and American culture to the different styles of chess games that we have, which I thought was pretty interesting. In American chess in order to win a player must destroy their opponent's pieces and sacrifice their own. However, in Weiqi (Go), the object of the game isn’t to destroy the opponent but rather just to have more territory in the end. It’s a much more peaceful game which results not in someone’s demise, but in two people sharing a board where one person is just a bit bigger than the other. He said the best ways to learn about Chinese culture are to learn the language, play Go, and practice calligraphy. Seems easy enough.<br><br>

		As we neared the end of the day, a pain in my mouth that I had attributed to burning my tongue a couple days earlier began to intensify. It was getting difficult to eat anything or even talk normally. Taking a look in a mirror I noticed that I had these white ulcers underneath and on the sides of my tongue. I’ll leave out any more graphic details don’t worry. I figured they would just disappear after a couple days but as the days continued and the pain intensified, I figured I should probably go see a doctor or something. Will (my guardian angel and absolute savior) and I walked into a walk-in clinic/pharmacy type thing and after showing them my mouth they gave me some medicine which turned out to be an oral numbing gel and some “fire purging” tea. I began the treatment as we set off for our full-day Tiger Leaping Gorge hike. After another 5am wake-up and 4-hour bus ride, we were at the foot of a beautiful mountain overlooking a gorge. We began our ascent and quickly realized that the trail wasn’t marked at all and at multiple intersections we chose paths that led us astray (including but not limited to: a trail that led us into someone’s personal garden containing among other things a cage with monkeys in it, and a newly paved road that was so newly paved that our shoes sunk into the pavement and left permanent marks, right before being yelled at to go a different way.). On our journey, we walked through herds of horses, walked through waterfalls, and took lots of water breaks. I guess I should really start working out or at least go on runs.<br></p>

		The next leg of our journey took place at Lugu Lake, a massive beautiful lake with ethnic minority groups surrounding the shores. While being there was a breathtaking and relaxing experience, getting there was a whole different story. The morning we left we woke up early and walked around Lijiang trying to find the right bus station to buy a bus ticket to get to Lugu Lake. Like the trails of Tiger Leaping Gorge, there was no signage to help people find their way. After walking around for an hour, we found a station that sold tickets to Lugu Lake but they only had 1 ticket left. We managed to get help from someone who worked there and she advised us to buy tickets to a town halfway instead, and then transfer there to another bus that would take us the rest of the way. We didn’t see any other options so we followed her advice and got on the 3-hour bus ride to the halfway point. Upon arriving we got out in the middle of a highway where another man with a small van was stopped in the middle of the road. We were ushered inside with another family and buckled in for the second 3-hour trip. Halfway there, our driver told us that there is a foreigner’s tax for entering Lugu Lake and if we didn’t want to pay it we should hide from the border police. Not wanting to pay the extra price Will and I decided to try hiding. 10 minutes before reaching the border we unpacked a bunch of our clothing and covered ourselves in the back of the van such that (hopefully) it just looked like a pile of clothes. Upon reaching the border, however, we were easily discovered and had to pay for a ticket. It seemed like everyone was paying though, so perhaps something was lost in translation, or maybe the driver of our van just wanted to see a couple foreigners attempt to smuggle themselves into the area. We finally entered the Lugu Lake area and dropped the other family off. Right before we left for our destination, however, a man on the street started yelling at our driver. He got out of the car and after a comically short amount of arguing time a fist fight broke out in the middle of the street right behind our van! We were shocked but at the same time had front row seats and couldn’t look away. It seemed like our driver was getting the best of the other guy; he had landed a couple punches to the face almost unreciprocated. However, the newcomer had friends who quickly joined in the fray and turned the tide in the complete opposite direction. Our driver was slammed into the back window of our van right where we were watching from! It felt like we were up against the glass at a hockey game. As he was clearly outmatched and had taken a beating enough to calm his aggression, the fighting stopped and everyone retired to the sidewalk for a smoke break. As our driver sat on the curb with his dusty suit and head wounds smoking a cigarette, Will and I decided that this would be a good time to leave and find another driver. Surprisingly, this was hard to do. We walked all over the little town using what Chinese we could to ask people for directions to the area just 10 miles North where our hostel was. People seemed not to know or just unwilling to be helpful. After a couple hours of walking around and with our frustrations rising, Will managed to negotiate with the hostel to send a driver to come to pick us up. <br><br>

		We stayed two nights there and spent the majority of our time doing small hikes to incredible viewpoints and walking around the lake. One area that was truly amazing was a small island that you could only get to by walking on small cinderblocks that were centimeters above the water level. There was only one path, so you had to time it well such that nobody was coming from the other direction, otherwise someone would have to step into the water. Other than a hill with a great view of the lake, the island boasted four or five houses whose bottom floors acted as restaurants and top floors acted as hotels. On our last night, while we were sitting under the awning of a house while it poured with rain, a couple families preparing to eat dinner together invited us in to join them. We had a lovely meal with them (although my mouth ulcers still prevented me from enjoying most foods that weren’t coconut milk) and spent the remainder of the night talking. Again, Will dominated the conversation as they didn’t speak English so my participation was minimal, but I was thankful to enjoy the free food and tea and company.<br></p>

		Upon leaving Lugu Lake we took a 6-hour bus ride back to Lijiang and then took another night train back to Kunming where we would spend the last few days of our trip. Before that, however, in our last night in Lijiang we passed by a bar with live music so we decided to check it out. We were immediately asked by a group of people our age to join them at their table. We played different drinking games and tried a sake-like liquor that was super sweet. It literally might have just been simple syrup, I’m not sure. After the band ended their set, they joined us at our table and let me play guitar for a few songs as well, which was pretty cool since I was useless trying to communicate in Chinese in a loud venue. Thus ended our Lijiang leg of the journey. <br><br>

		Arriving in Kunming as you can imagine after all the hiking and traveling we had been doing, we were pretty burned out. We spent our time in Kunming exploring the city, renting bikes, and playing Go in coffee shops when it rained (which happened frequently). Finally, it was time to head home and we boarded our last 8-hour bullet train back to Shenzhen, which has begun to feel like home sweet home.<br><br>

		HUGE shoutout to Will for putting up with my strange ailments and unfit body, my inability to pay for anything as I didn’t have a bank account at the time, as well as being our sole translator in a country that is not very foreigner friendly. Mom, please send this boy a gift as I would not have made it this far without him.<br><br>

		This past week we’ve been taking it easy in Shenzhen. We went out one night with a bunch of other expats (we all met at a bar literally called “xpats”) including a guy from Tufts!
		We experienced our first bad air quality day with the AQI (air quality index) reaching 160. I’ve spent a lot of time reading (I’ve almost finished Murakami’s 1Q84) and playing dominion with Will (shoutout to Keyrus boardgames crew!).<br><br>

		At the time that I send out this email, I will have almost spent a month in China. Time has been flying for me, I wonder if it has been the same for all of you. I start my teaching job at a public middle school around the corner from where I live next week. How I am qualified to teach this job I am not so sure but I will tell you all about my first experiences and impressions of teaching in my next email! Don’t be a stranger!<br><br>

		Miss you all,<br><br>

		TLDR: Took a trip to Yunnan which had incredible natural beauty. People there were obsessed with us, we had many interactions with people who wanted to take our pics and/or spend quality time with us. I refuse to go on another bus/train for the next short while as we spent countless hours on them during our trip. Will is an angel and we are all lucky he exists on this Earth. I start teaching in a week!
