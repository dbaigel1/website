			Hey everyone, <br><br>

			It’s felt like ages since I last wrote one of these (although in actuality it’s been less than a month) since my life has been a complete whirlwind the last few weeks. The biggest events being that I started my new teaching job, meant a bunch of new expat teaching colleagues, and traveled to Hong Kong. Of those things, the new teaching job has been the most exciting, unpredictable, and new thing for me so I’ll just jump straight into that. <br><br>

			Before I begin however, I should warn you that the majority of this email might come off as a bit of a rant. The lack of communication and assistance I have received from both the company that hired me and the school I work for has not set me up for success, to say the least. Let it be known that I have no prior teaching experience, have not been trained to be a teacher (other than a laughable TEFL course that taught me that I need to spend my money more wisely), and I have never really interacted with children. Somehow I am now an English teacher in a public elementary school in China.<br><br>

			The week before school started the company that hired me that places teachers in schools in Shenzhen held a 2-day orientation. On the first day we talked about how to set yourself up for success in China which included: downloading WeChat, getting a Chinese SIM card, getting a Chinese bank account, finding an apartment etc. Essentially all things that Will and I struggled to do by ourselves when we moved here a month prior. The second day was just as useless as the first in that I learned nothing that would help me succeed as a teacher, but I did get to meet all the other foreign teachers. All of whom had the same complaints as me; the company that hired us did little to help us. At this stage, a Thursday evening before classes supposedly started on Monday, I still had no idea what school I would be teaching at or what grades I would be teaching. I was a bit nervous.<br><br>

			Later that night I received a text saying that I had to give a demo lesson at a school the next morning. For what age group? No idea. What is a demo lesson? No idea. How long should the lesson be? They’ll tell me when I get there. I immediately started planning lesson plans for elementary aged kids, and middle school aged kids. I asked for help from other teachers I had met during the orientation and after a long night had mustered up some material that I thought could convince them to let me stand in a classroom in front of children everyday for a year. The next morning I received a text saying they delayed the demo until 2pm, which was cool, gave me more time to prepare. At 2pm I met up with a person from my company and five other teachers also giving demo lessons. It turns out we were interviewing at a school group which owned a bunch of public schools in the area. When we got there they had us sit in a classroom together. One by one they took us into a new room for the demo, of course, I was picked first. In the room they gave me a sheet of paper with some vocabulary words on it like “bank”, “grocery store”, and “living room”. They told me that I had 15 minutes to create an 8-minute demo lesson for a middle school aged class. Great. Time to use my improv skills I guess. They watched me write a lesson plan in a classroom like hawks, so I couldn’t just whip out my phone and look up sample lesson plans. I decided to structure my lesson just like a sample lesson I had watched online the night before, but tailored it to locations in a house rather than the topic the online one had, sports. I can’t quite remember what my lesson entailed as this was a few weeks ago now, but I remember walking into the classroom, realizing that I was teaching the lesson to 6 teachers instead of a classroom of kids, and scrapped the majority of what I had planned as it wouldn’t work without a full classroom of children. After a painful 5 minutes, I ended my lesson on “rooms of the house”. The only comment I got was that I didn’t use the full time. Fingers crossed!<br><br>

			I didn’t hear anything until Monday morning, when I got a text saying that they want to hire me for one of their schools and that I had to go see the school that morning. A small win, but now the real test began. I was to teach 3rd-5th grade at a school 20 minutes by bus from my apartment called Lilin primary school. I went that afternoon and met some of the teachers there. Everyone seemed really nice and excited to have an American as part of their staff. Work began the next day for me, meaning I had one evening to prepare three different lesson plans, one for each grade. I asked them for a syllabus, which they didn’t have. So, I asked them if there were textbooks they wanted me to use, which there weren’t. Teaching materials were up to me to decide as well. Great. Sitting at home that night I racked my brain for what a good first lesson would be for kids in each age group. With an open canvas and no direction it was incredibly difficult to pick a topic. It didn’t help that my VPN wasn’t working either so browsing the internet for ideas wasn’t really an option. I turned to some of the other foreign teachers for advice and a guy named Sam sent me the lesson plan he made, a true hero. I decided to just use it for all three grades and call it a night. I had no idea what skill level these kids would be at, so without a point of reference I decided to see what would happen.<br><br>

			I showed up to my first class with both my laptop and a usb stick with my powerpoint presentation on it. Unfortunately the classrooms have no way to handle that, according to the teacher who brought me to the class. Instead I was supposed to upload any presentations I had to their server beforehand. Thanks for the heads up guys! I ran back up to my office (yeah I get an office how cool is that) and one of the other teachers helped me navigate the school’s file system, which needless to say is all in Chinese. I ran back down to my first class and began the lesson (which I’ve attached to this email in case you all are curious). This whole server thing is frustrating because it means I can never edit my slides in class, or even at school. The school doesn’t have wifi so my laptop is useless if I want to do anything on the internet, and Microsoft isn’t a thing here so the school computer that I was given can’t edit my slides either. If I ever want to make a change I have to wait until I get home, make the changes on my laptop, put the new slides on the usb, and then re upload them the next morning on the school server. Not ideal.<br><br>

			However, all the struggles I had dealt with up until this point pale in comparison to what I had to deal with in the classroom. My first day of school I had three different classes, two 4th grade and one 5th. My only description for each class would be ‘total disaster’. I wish that I was recording the whole thing because it was so outrageous. I don’t even know where to begin. I suppose firstly I should say that each class has 50 students in it. That’s not an exaggeration. 50 students. A couple have closer to 60. I teach 20 classes every week for a total of 1000 students. Wish me luck. The English skill level in a given class ranges from students who do not understand nor speak a word of English, to students who ask me things like what my favorite type of seafood is or whether or not I prefer Shenzhen to New York and why, and everything in-between. How do you teach classes like that? If I teach to the students that are really struggling, I lose the attention of everyone else. If I teach to the top performers in the class, I also lose people’s attention. In either scenario the classroom becomes a nightmare. Also, I am the only teacher in the room. I don’t have a teaching assistant to help me communicate ideas when they don’t understand or quiet the class down when they are noisy. Which leads me to the thing that has been the most difficult, and that is discipline. I’d say at this stage that my job is 80% discipline and 20% actually teaching, maybe even a 90-10 split in my 3rd grade classes. For example, in my first class perhaps 3 minutes in, there a few students in the front that were engaged and listening, there was a group of students in the back left noisily talking to each other, and a couple of students were strangling each other with the curtains in the back right corner. The rest of the students were watching the scene and commentating on it out loud as if they were sports announcers. I tried quieting everyone down, but with my quiet voice and mild temperament it was difficult for me to make my presence commanding enough to stop the ruckus. <br><br>

			<br><p>
			This type of scene happened in each one of my classes on the first day. I went home, completely overwhelmed and defeated. I doubted my choice in becoming a teacher. Maybe I had reached too far out of my comfort zone. I didn’t know what to do with myself, so I wrote a 'pros and cons list’, something I hadn’t done since deciding on whether I wanted to move to China or not. The highlights of which were as follows:<br><br>
			<ul> Pros:
			    <li>I had a pretty easy commute</li>
			    <li>The teachers at the school were friendly</li>
			    <li>I had some support from other foreign teachers at my company (though I didn’t want to rely on them too much)</li>
			</ul>

			<ul> Cons:
			    <li>I have no teaching experience</li>
			    <li>I have never interacted with children</li>
			    <li>I was not given a syllabus, textbook, or teaching materials</li>
			    <li>I was not trained</li>
			    <li>I was not told what level the students would be at</li>
			    <li>I was not told what school or grades I’d be teaching until the day before
			    </li>
			    <li>I didn’t know the technology that would be available in the classrooms</li>
			</ul>

<br><br><p>
			You get the idea, the cons greatly outnumbered and outweighed the pros. I don’t think a pros and cons list really makes sense in this situation, like I wasn’t trying to make a decision on doing something or not, but I just needed to write down my frustrations so that I had a reason for why my first day was such a failure. You can ask Will, that entire evening I was a total mess. I generally don’t show stress if I’m feeling it, but I definitely was that day.<br><br>

			The days following the first day got better and better over time. I knew what to expect, and got used to Chinese school culture. In China the students stay in one classroom the whole day while teachers move from room to room. At first I didn’t know if I should leave a class of 50 students alone for the 10-minute break in-between classes, or if I should wait for their next teacher to come. I decided to wait just to be safe, but was told that I could just leave them alone in the future. Seems dangerous to me… There’s also a 2 and a half hour lunch break from 12pm to 230pm? Sweet deal, but it just means that my days are longer than they need to be.<br><br>

			Discipline issues and Chinese classroom culture aside, there are some pretty amazing things about being a foreign teacher in a Chinese school. The best parts of my job are without a doubt the interactions I have with the kids between class ending and me trying to leave the classroom. I say trying because after each period, the students rush up to the front and swarm me. One student couldn’t stop herself from touching my beard, one student gave me a sheet of paper with his telephone number on it, one student asked if I liked Chinese food and then invited me over to her house for dinner, claiming that her mom makes really good Chinese food. I’ve had students tell me how handsome I am and that I have pretty eyes. I’ve had students ask if we can hang out after school, and I’m being asked constantly to take a photo with them. If you all ever need a confidence booster, I recommend becoming a teacher in China. I’ve never felt famous before, but I feel like a complete celebrity at school. Just walking from my office to a classroom down the hall I get said ‘hello Daniel!’ to 10-20 times, and maybe 2-3 “you’re so handsome”’s or so. My favorite comment in a class however, has been the student who raised her hand 10 seconds into my lesson and asked “Why are you handsome in your photo, but not in person”? It was a blow to my self-esteem, but I think I needed it given all the attention I had been getting. <br><br>

			Of course there are still days that are tough, each day is a new adventure. Just the other day I watched a kid in thr front row (while I was literally talking) turn to his friend and sucker punch him in the face. The friend of course grabbed his face and broke down crying. I was so stunned that a kid would do this right in front of my eyes while I was teaching and the classroom was relatively quiet for once. Luckily, one of the other students said he would take him to the nurse's office, which I didn’t even know existed. As for the kid who punched him, I didn’t know what to do with him. After the class, I asked one of the other teachers what to do in that situation and she said that I should just ignore it. That maybe sheds a light into what I’ve been dealing with.  <br><br>

			The last thing I’ll say about my job is that on the Monday of my second week unbeknownst to me there was a holiday called Teacher’s Day. I’m not sure if this is a thing back in the US, if it is I don’t remember ever celebrating it. Basically it is what it sounds like, a day across the entire country where teachers are recognized for how amazing they are (and trust me I now know what teachers have to go through, they deserve a teacher’s day every month). When I walked into my office, my desk was covered in flowers. Throughout the day, students would come into my office and give me more flowers or letters or even gifts. I had been teaching there for only a week and I was getting gifted for being a teacher, something I still barely even consider myself. I’m an adult in a classroom at best. Among the gifts I received was a bluetooth speaker, a blender, and my favorite: a women’s designer leather sun parasol. Definitely bringing that one back home to start a new fashion trend.<br><br>

			In short, teaching has been a wildly overwhelming experience but I think as I start getting better at making lesson plans and discipline in the classroom, it will become easier. <br><br>

			I’ll quickly summarize my first trip to Hong Kong before signing off because I know this email is long and you just read a crazy rant about one topic. After my first week of teaching, Will and I decided to check out Hong Kong for the weekend. It took about 2 hours to get from my apartment in Shenzhen through the Hong Kong border to downtown Hong Kong (although apparently this process will only take 15 minutes when the bullet train opens next week). I was blown away by how Western it felt. First of all, everyone speaks some English there. They had more than just Chinese food options, so we ate burritos and my god was it the best burrito I’ve ever had. The people diversity was huge, similar to New York. There were so many different cultures and languages being spoken, a stark contrast to Shenzhen where everyone is Chinese and only speaks Mandarin. It was crazy how these cities could be so close to each other yet so different.<br><br>

			We spent our time there exploring the different areas of the city. We took a day to hike a mountain on Lantau island and ended up seeing a massive Buddha statue as well. Another night we went to a jazz bar and saw some live music, and another morning we had delicious dim sum. Easily the best pork buns I’ve ever had, so if you’re planning on visiting me you can bet I’ll take you there. The only downside to HK is that it’s super expensive, probably equivalent to NYC prices. Not the best place to travel to if you’re on my teacher’s salary.<br><br>

			I am currently writing this email while pent up in my apartment with a massive typhoon looming outside. I know hurricane Florence is in the news, but if you were unaware there is also a massive typhoon hitting the Hong Kong-Shenzhen area. Funny how I am all the way here and still experiencing a similar thing to you guys. I hope all of you are doing well wherever you are in the world, and I look forward to hearing from you! As always, feel free to reach out to me by whatever means is easiest for you, as long as it’s WeChat then it works for me.<br><br>

			All the best,<br><br>

			Baigs<br><br>

			TLDR; I am a teacher now and it has been a super overwhelming experience. I teach 3rd-5th graders with 50 kids in each class. Discipline has been the biggest issue, but I think that I’ll get better at controlling classes over time. The kids here are obsessed with me, entirely because I am the only foreigner in the school. I also went to Hong Kong and it was western and an incredible break from mainland China.
