			Hi everyone! It has been a while since I last sent an email, so I hope all is still well. I’ve been traveling a bunch this month, which marks the third month of my journey. It’s crazy to think that if I decide to only stay in China for this one year, my time here is already 25% done. While I don’t feel completely at home here still, and I don’t think I ever will, it is amazing how settled in I am. I have my work routine down, I have my favorite restaurants around me that I frequent, my social life revolves around weekend trips, exploring with Will, and occasionally meeting up with other foreign English teachers. I also recently purchased a $30 guitar on TaoBao (Chinese Amazon) just to make me feel even more at home. While this past month has been characterized by settling into my job and weekly routine, I have done quite a lot of traveling, so I’ll tell you all about that. As always there will be a TLDR at the end of this email. <br><br>

For those of you who have reached out to me concerned about my well-being after I described my teaching situation, things have gotten better! Well, to be completely honest, I think I more or less just know what to expect now. I have singled out the most disruptive classes and even the specific students in those classes who give me the most trouble. There are also classes that are well-behaved and it’s a joy to teach them. Out of the 3 grades I teach, I find my 3rd graders the best as they are old enough to pay attention (though not too old to think they’re too cool for school) and young enough to be completely enamored by a foreign teacher. After most classes my third grade students will rush to the front where I stand and hug me, touch my arms, and ask me the hard-hitting questions like “you have so much hair, are you a woman”? Or “Why are you so fat”? Mom, according to my students I have put on some weight so you don’t have to worry about me not eating enough. The past couple of weeks a few girls in one of my classes have been standing outside my office pulling faces at me, and when I go outside to greet them they grab onto me like their lives depend on it and only release their grips when the bell for the next class rings. Also, I made the mistake of giving one of my students my email address after he had been asking me for it for weeks. Not only does he email me “good morning” and “good night” every day and then ask me at school why I never responded, but now all my other students want my email address. I gave it to one student but I am beginning to realize how critical a mistake this could turn out to be. I might have to burn this email address after leaving China.<br><br>

In China there is a holiday called "National Day”, which actually lasts a week so it’s nicknamed “Golden Week”. With this vacation I decided to travel to Vietnam! I had never been and it was one of the countries on the top of my list, accompanying Japan. However, when you get national holidays in China, you have to make up some of the missed time by working on the weekend. That means before my trip I had to work the Saturday and Sunday, and yes that means the students were in school too. Right as school ended I jumped on a bike for the train station so I could catch a high speed rail train to Hong Kong. The high speed rail has proven to be a really fast and great way to cross the Shenzhen-Hong Kong border. It takes you from downtown Shenzhen right to downtown Kowloon, Hong Kong. Upon arriving in Hong Kong, I took the airport express to the airport in order to catch my 3-hour flight to Hanoi, Vietnam. <br><br>

This was my first time traveling alone. The plan was to travel in and around Hanoi for 4 days, and then Will would join me in Ha Long Bay for the remainder of the trip. That meant I was on my own in a new country where English is not spoken. I was pretty excited actually. I don’t mind doing things by myself, and when you travel with other people there always has to be a group consensus on what to do or where to eat. Being alone meant that I could completely control my experience and do as much or as little as I wanted. Basically I could skip the museums and just do a food tour of Hanoi.<br><br>

When I arrived at my hostel I was shocked to see how lively it was. I have never lived in a frat house but my time there felt like what living in a frat house most likely feels like. By that I mean that the lobby, which had a large bar directly opposite the reception area, was filled with white guys in their late 20s with sleeveless tees and backwards hats double-fisting beers with loud pop music blaring in the background. Constantly. This made checking in when I arrived at 8pm a nightmare, as I couldn’t hear a word the reception was saying and wanted to talk to them about day trips, but decided to cut my losses and just check into my room. Other than the never-ending party downstairs, the hostel itself was quite nice. It cost $5 USD a night and included free breakfast, a free walking tour, and an assortment of trip packages that you could purchase. They also served fresh smoothies at the bar so no matter what happened the rest of the trip, I was happy. I put my backpack down in my room and one of my roommates, a guy in his late 20s with a sleeveless tee named Zander, started chatting with me. He had just flown in from New Zealand and was staying in the hostel for a month while looking for teaching jobs there. We were both traveling alone and he was extroverted enough to carry a conversation for the both of us so we decided to grab some food together and walk around the area. We were staying in an area of Hanoi called the Old Quarter, which was a maze of really narrow roads with more motorbikes than people and food stalls lining the sidewalks. We sat down on these tiny plastic chairs maybe 6 inches off the ground and ordered some Vietnamese food which included a plate of snails. Zander ordered a couple beers to occupy his hands. Walking onwards we came across a lake called Hoan Kiem Lake, which seemed to be the center of all nightlife in Hanoi. Something that struck me as we were walking was just how many foreigners there were. It seemed like for every Vietnamese person I saw there were two foreigners.<br><br> </p>

The next morning I took the complimentary walking tour that the hostel offered and walked around the old quarter during the day. We saw many markets and historical buildings, including the building where Ho Chi Minh wrote the Declaration of independence after WW2. We ended the tour at a hidden cafe where the specialty drink was called egg coffee, and is exactly what you think it is. It’s coffee mixed with a raw whipped egg and some cream/sugar. They also served egg beer, egg rum, and egg coke. We tried the egg beer and I definitely preferred the coffee. I spent the remainder of the day walking around the city eating different foods, including western favorites like Pho and Bahn Me, and recovering from drinking the egg beer. On day 3 I took a day trip to a village called Hoa Lu, which actually used to be the capital of Vietnam 1000 years ago. I toured some ancient temples where the queen and king used to live, and almost bought one of those conical rice hats to block the intense sun, but decided that it would be too touristy. After Hoa Lu I went to Tam Coc, which is a beautiful river that offers tours where locals row you (with their feet) in a small boat through caves and rice fields. I then rented a bike and rode through some roads that passed by the river until I had to catch a bus back to Hanoi. It was definitely an incredibly scenic few hours.<br><br> </p>

Will joined me the evening of the next day as we prepared to leave for Ha Long Bay, a UNESCO world heritage site that I can’t recommend enough. It’s a bay that features tons of islands and limestone karsts (I had to look up what that was too). Will and I stayed on Cat Ba island, which is a slightly smaller island on the outskirts of the bay. Since it was a little outside of the super touristy center, we basically had the island to ourselves. We dropped our bags, got some smoothies, and rented a pair of motorbikes for $3 each. Don’t worry mom we wore helmets. It took about 20 minutes to figure out how to control the bike (they didn’t exactly give us any lessons or even ask for driving licenses) but once I got the hang of it, driving a motorbike across a remote island was one of the most beautiful things I have ever done. We drove from one end of the island to the other, which took about an hour, and only stopped to fill up with gas and pick up Will’s phone which fell out of his pocket. At the other end of the island we rested on a ledge by the water, and while we were laying there Will’s phone decided to take on a life of its own again and dive into the bay. With little hesitation he jumped in to rescue it, and while he miraculously found it, it had sustained too much damage over the day to be resurrected. <br><br>

Near our hostel there was a big hill which according to reception had one of the best views in Vietnam. The top of the hill was called Cannon Fort, and originally was a military outpost built by Japan during World War 2. We decided to race our bikes back across the island to try to catch the 5:30pm sunset (it was already 4:30pm). Along the way Will’s bike ran out of gas again, so we stopped at a random person’s house/store to ask for petrol. He didn’t seem to have any but told us to wait there. He tucked his 2 year-old child under his arm, hopped on his motorbike, and came back 3 minutes later with a water bottle filled with petrol. It was pretty incredible how friendly everyone was, even though there was such a language barrier. With no more interruptions albeit a couple wrong turns, we coasted all the way to cannon fort. We had to get off to pay for entrance tickets, and when we returned to our bikes Will’s wouldn’t start back up! We tried for a few minutes, and a bunch of Vietnamese people upon seeing us having bike difficulties all came over to try to fix it. Apparently everyone in Vietnam is a mechanic. They deemed the bike broken, so we decided since we would miss the sunset by walking up to the top, that he should jump on the back of mine. I’m not sure how many of you all have ever driven motorbikes, but driving up a windy hill with two people is considerably harder than driving across a flat island by yourself. We took it a bit slow, and unfortunately despite all of our efforts, missed the sunset by a few minutes. The view from the top however was still staggering. The reception really didn’t lie when they said cannon fort had incredible views. My photography skills do not do it justice.<br><br></p>

The following day we decided to explore other islands in Ha Long Bay. We rented kayaks at the docks and the guy who rented them to us took us out on his boat through the bay to an island he recommended, called Monkey Island. We spent some time kayaking around the island first, stopping at random beaches and inlets along the way. Both of us shared a kayak, and while I was vastly out of shape, my tiredness was worth it. We beached our kayak on one of Monkey Island’s beaches and walked around a bit. We climbed to two different peaks on the island, one of which had stairs leading up to it and the other of which was basically rock climbing. We admired the views for quite some time, and then kayaked back to the boat that was meeting us to take us back to Cat Ba Island. That night we hiked Cannon Fort again in an attempt to catch the sunset, and while we made it up there in time, we ordered food at the cafe and didn’t finish eating until after the sunset again. I suppose I’ll have to go back one day to finally catch it.<br><br> </p>

A couple weeks after getting back to China, my friend Mikey, who also moved to China to teach English for a year, and I decided to meet up for a weekend trip. He and his girlfriend Hana are living in a tiny village in East China called Jinyun where they are the only foreigners. On top of that they also teach high school students with smaller class sizes and received lots of help with teaching materials/syllabus from their program. Basically, while were are both living in China we are having completely different experiences. We decided to meet up in a city called Xiamen. It’s one of the major port cities in China and is in-between where they live, and Shenzhen. It’s a beautiful city on the water that boasts both the world’s longest elevated bike path, and a pedestrian-only island called Gulangyu. Of course, we had to do both of these things. The island was small enough such that we could probably walk the whole thing given a few hours, but since we could only manage to get on a ferry at 3pm, we didn’t have enough time to see all of it. We prioritized the things we wanted to do most, which involved walking through the town, and watching the sunset from “sunlight rock”. I know, I love my sunsets.<br><br>

The city itself reminded me of Santa Monica, a place outside of LA that my sister had taken me to when I visited her (~shoutout to you Mbaigs~). The weather was perfect, there were palm trees everywhere, and there were tons of cafes right on the water. We stopped at some cafes, toured around an art district, rode bikes on the elevated bike path, and called it a trip. While we did a lot, we realized that doing everything in a city of nearly 4 million people in a single weekend was near impossible. Definitely looking forward to exploring another new city with Mikey and Hana soon!<br><br>

That sums up the traveling I’ve been doing up until now. I still have to visit Guangzhou, the massive metropolis 45 minutes from Shenzhen, and I imagine I’ll do more trips to Hong Kong in the near future. I already have tons of people coming to visit me starting in December all the way until March, so it won’t be too long before I leave China again. <br><br>

Meanwhile in China, Will and I have befriended this family that keeps taking us out to dinner. We were on our way to some board game meet up in our neighborhood, and when we got there we couldn’t find the right room in an apartment building. Just before giving up and going back home, a woman and her six-year-old child walked in and started talking to us, well, started talking to Will. I just stood on the sidelines and exchanged silly faces with the daughter while the adults talked. Pretty soon Will and the woman added each other on WeChat and before we knew it we were invited out to dinner. The parents and daughter took us out to a nice hot pot restaurant. Hot pot is a Chinese cooking style where customers cook their own food in a boiling bowl of soup. Throughout the dinner I said very few words, but had a great time tasting all the different dishes that were brought out. It definitely made me want to improve my Chinese though. The parents would be having a conversation with Will about something like the discrepancies between STEM education in the US and China, and then after 15 minutes or so they would feel the urge to include me. They would turn to me and ask a question like “How old are you?” or, “do you like China?”. And I would look to Will to help translate the words I didn’t know, and then respond with something like “I am 23” or “Yes, I like eating in China”. Not my proudest moments. The family took us out on another occasion just a week later, this time their daughter, who I connected with most on our last dinner since neither of us participated in the grown ups conversation, didn’t come. Instead they brought one of their daughter's teachers. We went to a great Thai restaurant, but as the night went on it became clear that this family wasn’t just trying to make us feel at home in China, but rather wanted to hire us as teachers in their new STEM education company they were starting. I played a very small role in the conversation again, I let Will handle navigating their questions while I savored the pineapple fried rice and coconut water.<br><br> </p>

That’s it for now, apologies that it took me a little longer than usual to get this update out. I miss you all and looking forward to hearing about life back in the states. Back to studying Chinese and writing lesson plans, I guess.<br><br>

Peace,<br><br>

TLDR; Teaching is getting a little easier, not because the students are better behaved, but because I know what to expect when I walk into each class now. While I don’t like teaching, I love the little moments in-between class where I get to interact with the kids. I Went to Vietnam for a week by myself and Will joined me halfway through. Hanoi was cheap and interesting with bad air pollution, and Ha Long Bay was an amazing beautiful experience. I met up with my high school friend Mikey who is also teaching English in China and is having a completely different experience from me. A random Chinese family keeps inviting Will and me out to dinner to try to convince us to join their STEM education startup as teachers. <br> </p>
