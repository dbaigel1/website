	<p>Hey everyone,  <br><br>

		I hope you all haven’t forgotten about me! Or if you have, that you at least remember me now that you’ve received this email. These last couple months have been filled with small trips, family & friends visiting me, and getting approached by ~hundreds of Chinese people for various reasons including and strictly limited to English lessons/language exchange. Seriously, I’ve been added on WeChat by tons of random people I meet on the Shenzhen streets. 

		<br><br>
		A quick example: After working out one fine evening I was waiting outside my favorite fried chicken food-stand to get some dinner when another man who was also waiting for his delicious yet totally unsanitary chicken asked me if I work out. (This place, like most food stands here, has raw meat sitting out in the open until someone decides to order it. I’ve even seen a guy kill a fly that was sitting on one of the pieces of meat and then peel it off the meat with his bare hand). I eloquently responded "yes", giving myself a mental and potentially visible fist pump for being able to understand his question. We exchanged a few painful back-and-forths thanks to his patience and my phone’s translate app, before he asked to add me on WeChat, which I accepted. We then went our separate ways never to talk again. This same kind of situation has happened a countless number of times including but not limited to the hairdresser that gave me my last haircut, the hairdresser's three friends that also worked at the barbershop but didn’t interact with me at all, one of the trainers at my gym who continually tells me I need to work out more because I’m “weak and skinny", and the entire movie theatre staff (3 people) at my local movie theatre. This coupled with the love and attention I get at school makes me feel like the most popular person alive. <br><br>

		Just after I sent my last update, I had the opportunity to go on a field trip with my school. I found out the day before and nobody told me where we were going but the next morning I was excited to spend some quality time outside of school with my students. When I got to school there were maybe 50 double decker coach buses waiting outside all packed with students ready to go wherever we were going. It turns out we were headed to a rock museum and unlike me, my students were absolutely amped. The hour long bus ride consisted of two main events. First, a man who seemingly was hired to entertain the students did 30 minutes of stand up comedy. Either everyone was super tired and not paying attention, or this man was terrible at telling jokes, for nobody was laughing. I wish I understood what he was saying. After his set, he turned on the radio which immediately rejuvenated the crowd as everyone sang along to Chinese and American songs alike. He came up front to sit with me, asked me where I was from and then asked for my WeChat.<br><br>

		The museum consisted of three floors of rocks. I’m not really sure what was so special about this place, there was literally no context on any floor, just single rocks or gems sitting behind glass with little signs that said the English name and Chinese name of the stone. Regardless, these kids were excited to be there, most likely because they would be happier anywhere than in a classroom all day. I was constantly being pulled by kids who individually wanted to show me pieces of slate, or ruby gemstones, or diamonds. We spent maybe 20 minutes there before all the kids took buses to a local beach and all the teachers took buses to a hotel where we took naps and ate lunch. We never interacted with the kids again and after lunch took the buses home. So much for spending quality time with my students.<br><br></p>

		In other news my life here is probably as acclimated as it will get. I’ve got my routine down, and have finally grown used to the stares I get everywhere I go, the different food options, and nonstop spitting of locals. Not to get too descriptive but you know that deep phlegm throat clearing sound people make occasionally and then everyone around them is grossed out and gives them disapproving looks? Everyone does that here, from grandmothers to 2-year olds. I attribute it to the poor air quality more than anything. Anyway, I have my routine down where I go to school in the days and then study Chinese, or play guitar, and grab dinner with Will. We also play board games once every week or so with a board games group we found near where we live. I supplement this routine by taking as many trips as I can to explore new places.<br><br>

		Will and I took one day to check out Guangzhou for the first time. Only 40 minutes away on the high speed rail, Guangzhou is another major metropolis boasting an urban population of over 14 million, and is the capital of Cantonese cultural in mainland China. We only spent 24 hours there but filled our time by trying to see as much of the city as we could. We started our day off at the Sacred Heart Cathedral, one of the few remaining active churches in Guangzhou. It looked like something you would see in Europe, which makes sense as it was built during the Second Opium War with influence from Britain and France. We then took a bus to the South Tea Market, which despite being the biggest tea market with the highest quality tea I had ever been to, was surprisingly empty. We got stuck in one of the shops tasting endless tea while conversing to the store owners who were excited to talk to a Chinese-speaking foreigner and his semi-illiterate foreigner companion. We left to check out Shamian island, an old foreigners residential area now turned tourist site. It boasts European architecture, which is hard to come by in China, and a green area for strolling. It was nice, but like, whatevs. There’s more to see and do in this city. We took a metro over to the famous Beijing street which is a massive pedestrian area with tons of restaurants, shops, and yes even a chinchilla store. After buying some fresh kicks we put them on and ran over to a different area of the city that is known to house the biggest African immigrant community in all of China. We walked around a bit, Will bought more shoes, and then we left for the new city to see the public library and the Canton Tower, the iconic landmark of Guangzhou. We then finished our day under the Canton Tower by eating some of the best dim sum I’ve eaten yet. All before our 8pm train back to Shenzhen. While this paragraph was probably boring for most of you to read as nothing crazy or interesting happened, I mostly just wanted to brag about how much we did in under 24 hours. Although, it’s all a bit of a blur now so I will definitely have to go back.<br><br></p>

		Just a week later my friends Mikey and Hana (you might remember their names from my previous update) flew down to Hong Kong for a week during one of their vacations. I met them there for the weekend and played tour guide as best I could, though we mostly did things I hadn’t done before. The two standouts for me were hiking Dragon’s Back, and taking the tram up at night to see the view from Victoria’s Peak. The views and company were spectacular, the photos were high quality, and the salmon curry I ate for dinner in a little village called Tai O next to Dragon’s Back was pretty good. <br><br>

		Finally, the moment you’ve all been waiting for, or at least what I had been looking forward to the most, was a visit from my mom and sister! They flew into Hong Kong on Tuesday, and I met them there on Wednesday. (I got Thursday and Friday off of school for some sports activities/competitions — perfect timing!). We did all the things I enjoy in HK, from eating at Tim Ho Wan for dim sum, to hiking Dragon’s Back and seeing the view from Victoria’s Peak, to calling it an early night due to “jet lag”. It also happened to be my mom’s birthday while we were in Hong Kong so we celebrated by eating at a fancy Cantonese restaurant called Tin Lung Heen. Last year we were in Chile for my mom’s birthday and went to a restaurant called Borago, which has been my favorite eating experience in this life so far, so we tried to replicate that in Hong Kong. Dinner was delicious, and we had an amazing view of the Hong Kong skyline to go with it.<br><br>

		Our time in Hong Kong came to an end and we all took the train to Shenzhen. I still had work the week they visited, so each morning I would go to work, and when I got off I would take the train to wherever they were. According to both my mom and sister, the highlight of their trip was when they came to sit in on one of my classes at school. They watched one of my 4th grade classes that also happens to be my most well-behaved class and for that reason one of my favorites to teach. Before class started I took my visitors to come meet the other teachers I share an office with. They were given a warm welcome of tea and chicken feet; They graciously accepted the tea. Then a few students came in as they usually do before class so that they could walk with me in the hallway. They stood there like deer in headlights when they saw my family, but quickly got excited and started asking them questions. Pretty soon there were 20 students crowding the room as word had gotten out that there was a 200% increase in the number of foreigners in school today. They continually told my sister that she was so pretty and for some reason loved asking my mom how old she was. The bell rang and as we walked into the classroom the students’ usual cheer turned into piercing excited screams as they all realized that they had two new guests today. My mom and sister stood in the back of the classroom, while I played a review game with my students. Amazingly there were no major fights, nobody cried, and the noise level was tolerable. Although my mom and sister later told me that two kids in the back of the room were playing with knives and smashing their desks into each other. <br><br> </p>

		Another highlight of our time in Shenzhen was at the Dafen oil painting village. I had never been here before as it’s nearly two hours away from where I live, but I had heard good things so we went to go see it one day after school. Upon leaving the metro station however, I realized I had no idea how to find it. I had underestimated how good at hiding an entire village could be. <br><br>

		We wandered around for quite a while, stopped for some lunch, wandered around some more and eventually stopped to consult the internet. While all staring down at our phones, an older man approached us and asked if we needed help. Miraculously he spoke pretty good English and also knew exactly how to get where we wanted to go to. We walked along for 20 minutes (we had been walking in the total opposite direction) and eventually we found it tucked behind a massive construction area. There’s no chance I would have found it without him. We spent some time walking around the village, which had small cobblestone streets lined with small open-faced houses where artists were painting away. If you’ve ever bought generic oil paintings on Amazon to add some atmosphere to your dorm room (like I have), then you might be interested to hear that this village is where they are made. I literally saw multiple copies of a monkey wearing headphones painting that I have bought on Amazon before. Just type in ‘oil painting wall decoration’ into Amazon and everything that pops up is made there. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/DVQ-Art-Framed-Painting-Headphone-16x24inch/dp/B01MZXFUZG/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1545980499&sr=8-5&keywords=monkey+oil+painting">Monkey link.</a>

		That night Will joined us in Luohu, the Eastern part of the city, for dinner. I wanted to make sure that my sister ate some of the Chinese classics before she left. We found a food court and passed by an insect stand, where my sister insisted on trying scorpion. Scorpion definitely isn’t a Chinese classic and almost certainly a tourist trap, but who was I to stop her? We all ordered a scorpion and were pleasantly surprised by how crunchy and flavorless they were. The next stop was stinky tofu, a food I had tried before in Taipei, and hated. For those of you who don’t know it, stinky tofu is a fermented tofu that smells like the worst smell you can think of times 1000. When you’re walking around and you smell it, you’ll instantly know when a stinky tofu stand is nearby. We had no problem sniffing out a stand, and ordered a bowl full of it for the three of us to eat. Unfortunately they put so much spicy sauce on top that it was hard to really taste the tofu as it had an overwhelmingly spicy flavor that limited us to just a couple bites each. We washed that down with some sugarcane juice we bought at the stand next door.

		We ended our time together by taking the high speed rail up to a city called Guilin, and staying in a town just outside of it called Yangshuo. It was a bit chilly this time of year, especially considering that I’ve been living in 70+ degree heat since arriving in China. We spent the weekend mostly admiring the beautiful scenery of natural karst rock formations (similar to the ones in Ha Long Bay, Vietnam). Our first morning there we took a bamboo raft down a river and enjoyed the landscape. It was quite misty that day, which gave the entire valley a mysterious yet peaceful feel. That afternoon we hiked up a mountain called Xiang Gong mountain which offered a beautiful view of the Li River, after climbing endless stairs of course. (It was actually not endless but rather 950 stairs. Yes, we counted.). <br><br>

		Our taxi dropped us off at West Street, a famous tourist street in Yangshuo that can get pretty crowded at night. It’s filled with restaurants and stores selling all sorts of things such as jewelry, beef jerky, and clothing. The best moment of the night happened just after dinner. We had left the restaurant and walked for perhaps five minutes when my mom realized that we had forgotten a bag back inside. I decided I’d run back to get it and meet them at the top of the street. After picking up the bag though, I was stopped by a 6 or 7-year old girl in the street. She said “hello” to me and asked if I had a minute to spare. I told her of course I did, as teaching has now made me way more affectionate/welcoming towards children. She then handed me an envelope and said “Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!”. Her dad came over then and asked if he could take a photo of us, and I obliged. They then said thank you and wished me a happy new year again and went on their way. I was so taken aback that someone at that age would approach a stranger, who doesn’t speak their language, just to wish them well AND give them a homemade holiday card. The card read, My dear friend, we wish you Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! -Kiki”. Best gift ever. My only regret is not asking them to send me the photo. </p>

		The next morning we woke up and walked a portion of the ’Ten-Mile Gallery’, a picturesque walking road next to a river that takes you through old villages. It was a beautiful day, and a great way to end our time in Yangshuo. We hurried back to the hotel because we had forgotten our passports in the room safe, and caught a taxi to the train station. That night, as it was my family’s last night in Shenzhen, I stayed in their hotel with them. According to my sister she enjoyed Shenzhen the most, then Yangshuo, then Hong Kong. Feel free to reach out to her for her detailed report which may or may not be “Shenzhen was clean and cool”. In the morning I said goodbye to them as they set off for Vietnam for a week, and took the subway back to my apartment. Will had left for the US while I was in Guilin, so the past week I’ve had the place to myself. <br><br>

		On Christmas Eve I got invited to hang out and have dinner with our friend Ty, who is the main guy we play boardgames with, and his friends at an airbnb he rented back in Luohu. To my surprise when I got there, dinner was Turkey with mashed potatoes, gravy, and cranberry sauce. So festive! I hadn’t had real Western food in a while, and it was perfect. <br><br> </p>

		That’s it for this update. I’m super excited for the upcoming couple months as the first semester of teaching is coming to an end, and I’ve got some big trips planned including a trip to Australia with my dad, and a trip to Japan with my friends from back home! Shout out to Owen, Becky, and Jake for coming all the way out to Asia to go exploring with me. As always feel free to reach out anytime and I’ll get back to you as soon as my VPN lets me. <br><br>

		Cool, <br><br>

		Baigs <br><br>

		TLDR; Went to Guangzhou and tried to see as much of it as I could in one day. Met up with friends in Hong Kong. Mom and sister visited me! We spent time in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Yangshuo. Had some American Christmas dinner in China with friends, and also have amassed tons of “friends” on WeChat just from people randomly asking for it on the streets. <br>
