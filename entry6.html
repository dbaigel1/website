			The past two months have been so busy with travel, I feel as if I could write multiple entries about them. Luckily for you all, I’m going to condense it all into one entry and just fill it with the most interesting of my stories. Why have I been so busy? From January 10th until February 17th I had a vacation from teaching for the Chinese New Year holiday, and traveled for every single day of it. I went to Thailand, Australia, and Japan, and had the opportunity to show friends and family around Shenzhen, Guangzhou, and Hong Kong. Having done so much, all the experiences are beginning to blend together so this post will act as a good way to remember the events that happened and organize my thoughts. Let's start with my last-second trip to Thailand. <br><br>

			On January 8th I was told by my school that instead of classes ending on the 20th, they actually were going to end on the 10th. With an extra 10 days added to my vacation time, I decided that a trip needed to be planned and taken. I was already scheduled to fly out to Australia to meet my dad on January 20th, which gave me 10 days to see an entirely new country. I began researching countries nearby in Southeast Asia and eventually settled on Thailand due to its proximity, price of last-minute flights, and abundance of things to see there. Will unfortunately still had work the following week so he was unable to make the trip, but a couple of my work friends (Max and Alistair) were also looking to travel so we all teamed up. We decided on going to Chiang Mai in Northern Thailand, staying there for a few days, and then renting motorbikes and taking them up to a town called Pai. <br><br>

		  Chiang Mai is a small city in Northern Thailand that is pretty overrun by tourists and filled with artsy coffee shops, Thai massage parlors, bike repair shops, and ancient temples, some of which date back to over 700 years ago. We spent our time there hopping from restaurant to restaurant, getting Thai massages (where they basically just beat you up for an hour) and checking out the myriad of cafes. Some major food highlights included papaya salad, kao soi (curry noodles), and of course pad thai. <br><br>

		  On our first night we stayed up late experiencing the local nightlife, and woke up early the next morning to rent motorbikes and take them to a ’sticky waterfall’. The sticky waterfall was a big waterfall system where the rocks were made out of limestone, allowing people to climb up and down it without needing any special gear or major athletic skills. To my surprise, I was able to navigate the perilous climb successfully while only falling a few times to watch packs of 6-year-olds pass me by. Fading quickly from the few hours of sleep we got the night before we decided to head back to our hostel for an early night, but only after a couple plates of pad thai and some mango smoothies.	<br><br> </p>

			The next morning was the morning of our big trip. We drove our bikes 80 miles North, driving the infamous 762 winding curves through beautiful mountain views and quaint villages until we arrived at a hippy village called Pai. Along the way we took multiple stops to sample the local dishes of the towns and check out any and every sign that claimed to lead to a waterfall. The drive took about four hours due to our numerous stops, and once we arrived filled me with relief as no major accidents happened. None of us were experienced motorbike drivers and to take them for a multi-hour drive across a country on a dangerous road didn’t seem like the safest idea at the time. I don’t like spoiling stories but in case you were wondering, we made it back without any injuries as well. </p>

			<p>
			In terms of tourism Pai made Chiang Mai look like a local untouched city. Pai reminded me of Woodstock, New York in the late 60s: a place I have never visited before but completely filled with American hippies. Everywhere we looked we saw foreigners with dreadlocks wearing free-flowing elephant pants and rags the size of bed sheets instead of shirts. The only Thai people we saw the whole time we were there were the ones manning the countless food stalls lining the one big touristy street in the village. We spent the day hiking the Pai canyon, a skinny path hundreds of feet up with no walls or rails, and relaxing in a natural hot spring. 
			<br><br>
			At the hot spring we got to watch some meditation class going on where a guy was softly speaking to a group of foreigners that were floating in the water in a circle around him. Each person was floating on his or her back with floaties on their ankles and wrists and another person was standing behind them holding their heads just above the water. They stayed that way for at least an hour, and a couple of them even broke down crying. I’m still unsure what exactly it was, probably some hippy thing I’ll never understand. <br><br>

			That night we walked the food stand street again and decided to leave Pai the next morning, a day earlier than we had planned to. While Chiang Mai was touristy as well, it at least offered more interesting day trips than being stuck in the middle of nowhere up North. Unfortunately at around 4am the next morning both Alistair and I woke up with violent food poisoning. Reasoning that biking three hours back through windy mountain turns with food poisoning probably wasn’t the best idea, we resolved to stay at the hostel drinking ginger ale and eating bread until we felt better. <br><br>

			Luckily for us 24 hours later we were feeling well enough to slowly ride the bikes back to Chiang Mai. However, the food poisoning did have a lasting effect in turning the last couple days of the trip into a more mellow experience. With the inability to try all the delicious foods and with the prospect that either one of us might need the bathroom at a moment’s notice, we took our last day easy, leisurely visiting some temples and villages, most notably being a village that specializes in making the colorful umbrellas you might find in tropical cocktails.<br><br>

			Our Thailand trip now over, I had to quickly shake off the food poisoning residue and get ready to visit my dad in Australia. This was my first time being in a truly Western country in six months and I didn’t realize how much I missed it until I got there. 24 hours after returning to Shenzhen I was waking up in a hotel in Melbourne after a post-flight nap. We walked around the city, got dinner with my dad’s cousins, and checked out Melbourne’s Chinatown; I had to test its authenticity. <br><br>

			I was actually really impressed by the hipness of Melbourne’s back alleys and its overall diversity. Maybe it’s just because I’ve been living in a very homogenous area, but Melbourne seemed like a true melting pot of backgrounds. I imagine when I return to New York I’ll feel similarly about that too. 

			<br><br>The reason my dad and I went to Australia was because he wanted to see the Australian open for the first time. I had forgotten how much I enjoyed watching and playing tennis until we walked onto the grounds and flashbacks of my high school tennis days played through my head. We got to see some great matches and had beautiful seats under the shade of the stadium (avoiding the Australian sun). I could summarize the eight days I spent in Australia by saying I got to watch some tennis and spend a lot of time with people triple my age, as my dad understandably wanted to connect with all his family he hadn’t seen in years. I did get to see some of my cousins closer in age to me in Melbourne and spend time with his two adorable children, as well as a friend of mine from New York now living in Sydney. <br><br> </p>

			One of the most memorable experiences in Australia was probably when I unexpectedly entered a sailing regatta for the first time. On our first day right after touching down in Sydney, we met up with my dad’s cousin Ivan. I was told that we’d be spending a couple of hours on his boat in Sydney Harbor. Joining the three of us was his son and son’s friend, as well as his cousins and their small children. The 10 of squeezed onto his sailboat and set off. After about five minutes of coasting through the breeze at precisely 6:28pm, Ivan asked me for the time. Naturally I responded with “nearly 6:30”. With a tone of annoyance in his voice he implored me for the exact time. "6:28” I said, beginning to regret getting on a boat with a bunch of strangers. He asked me to shout out the time on the minute every minute until 6:35. At this point I asked why, and he replied saying that 6:35 was when the race started. Sensing that I was a bit confused he had his son, who also happened to be my cousin, teach me how to tighten and loosen the ropes attached to the sails. Once the clock struck 6:35 and the race began, Ivan began barking commands at me and his fellow passengers (excluding the kids and my dad who got to sit back and watch). I was put to work running around a boat attempting to tighten and loosen ropes at a speed equal to the pace at which instructions were being yelled at me. Meanwhile the wind and waves were causing us to sway back and forth, the boat alternating between angles of about 30 degrees on either side. We had to make a series of sharp turns which caused some of the kids in the boat to begin crying, and others in the boat (potentially just me) to get seasick and question how anyone could find this fun. Although tightening and loosening ropes sounds like an easy task, when the boat you’re on is fully tilted on one edge and gravity is fighting against you, doing anything becomes a challenge. One hour later we cruised back to the docks and celebrated by enjoying some barbecue and watching the sunset. IT turns out we got second place in the race! At that point I vowed to follow one of my favorite idioms and quit while I was ahead. <br><br>

			After Australia I showed my dad around China, and celebrated my birthday in Hong Kong the night before leaving for Japan. Finally, a moment I had been looking forward to for years, I would get to visit Japan. I met up with my friends Jake, Becky, and Owen from Tufts in Tokyo the night of February 2nd. Unlike a lot of my travel I had done previously, our trip in Japan ran smoothly from day one until we left for China. That’s half due to the credit of Jake’s excellent planning abilities, and half due to the fact that Japan is an amazing country to visit, rich in culture, delicious food, and friendly locals willing to lend a helping hand. 
			<br><br>

			Traveling in a group always proves to be interesting since people like to travel in different ways. For example Jake loves to travel through food and so we made sure to sample everything from fresh sushi at Toyosu market, to ramen in Tokyo station, to Tonkatsu pork. I do want to take a second to explain the best meal we had on the trip, and probably one of the best meals I’ve had in general. One morning in Tokyo we woke up before sunrise to head over to Toyosu market, where the famous bluefin tuna auctions happen. That morning after watching some of the auctioning we ate breakfast at an omakase sushi restaurant called Sushi Dai. It consisted of 10 pieces of sashimi, of whatever fish was fresh that day. I truly had never had sushi like that before. The best of all was the last piece, which was the only piece we got to choose ourselves. After consulting with the waiter about what to order, we all settled on trying the seasonal special, cod sperm sacs. They had the exact consistency you’re probably imagining right now; slimy white sacs that popped in your mouth when you bite into them. Although it took a few seconds to adjust to, they actually were packed with flavor, an opinion that I alone may have held. <br><br> </p>

			Owen, while still enjoying trying all the food, put more emphasis on the cultural aspects of wherever we were visiting. We visited both the samurai and sumo museums, walked around the imperial palace, hiked through the Fushimi Inari shrine in Kyoto, and did a tour of the Okunoin cemetery and temple in Koyasan. One of the craziest moments for me in Japan was walking around some of the arcades in Tokyo. There were a plethora of massive multi-story arcades peppered all throughout the city that housed hundreds of people mindlessly clicking buttons on games they seemingly were born playing. Most impressive of all of them were the people playing some type of dance dance revolution remake. <br><br>

			 One of the highlights of the entire trip came from a recommendation Will gave me. Of course Will has to be mentioned in every entry at least once so here’s his sentence of fame. We left Kyoto for a mountain village called Koyasan on mount Koya. It took about three hours to get there, including a nauseating bus ride up the windy roads of the mountain. We stayed that night in a Buddhist temple in a traditional room with tatami mats. They served us a vegan dinner and breakfast, allowed us to attend the morning prayers at 6am, and they had a thermal spring bath which we completely took advantage of due to the freezing cold weather. We did a hike that afternoon, and toured the cemetery at night. What I loved about the cemetery was that over 200,000 people are buried there and they accept anyone from around the world practicing any faith. The next morning it began to snow so we took a scenic stroll through the cemetery again and left that afternoon for Osaka, our last day of the trip. After eating more sushi, walking through some markets, and eating one more bowl of ramen, we were ready to explore China. <br><br> </p>

			Arriving in Hong Kong we had a quick dim sum brunch before catching the bullet train to Shenzhen. Our first couple days in Shenzhen I was amazed to see how quiet everything was. Everyone from food stall owners to electronics market shop owners to regular pedestrians seemed to have left town for the holidays. A big chunk of our China trip was spent in Guangzhou. Right after getting to the hostel we decided to try to buy tickets to the Guangzhou Long Lions CBA (Chinese Basketball Association) game. We eventually found the stadium and after being hassled to buy scalped tickets from some people outside the front, we eventually decided to buy tickets we were confident were real from some security guards sitting outside the entrance. We had great seats near the front at a game that was less than half full. It was actually a super close game against the Beijing Ducks which ended in a close finish with Guangzhou winning by just a couple baskets. Each team had two American players that greatly overshadowed the rest of the players on the court. Each American player had 30+ points, though the Chinese players certainly had more fouls than the Americans; two of them even fouled out of the game. The craziest part of the game was that in the last quarter, both teams took out their star players. We couldn’t understand what the deal was, especially during such a close game. Only afterwards did we look up the rules and realize that there are constraints against non-Asian players. For example, each team can only have a maximum of two non-Asian players, who can only play a total of six quarters in a game. So in the case of the game we watched, both teams had maxed out the number of quarters they could play their foreigners by the last quarter. Also, each team can only play one foreign player in the last quarter. We also found out that there are rules in the league that apply only when playing a specific team. The Bayi Rockets, a team founded by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), has no foreign players and so when playing the Rockets teams must limit their foreigners to five quarters. <br><br> </p>

			We ate dim sum three times on this trip. Once in Hong Kong at Tim Ho Wan, a classic, and twice in Guangzhou. Our first attempt at eating dim sum in Guangzhou was quite a riot. We woke up our first morning after the basketball game, looked up the most recommended dim sum places, and headed for one that was nearby. Unfortunately it was closed, probably due to it still being the holidays. Another highly recommended dim sum spot was nearby so we walked the 15 minutes but when we got there, there was a huge line. Deciding that it would probably be worth the wait we decided to stay there and bide our time until a table was ready. It took nearly two hours. By the time we finally got to our table, we were grumpy and starving but excited to eat some good food. This particular restaurant only had Chinese menus with no pictures, so we asked the waitress if we could be taken around so that we could point at things either in the kitchen or just what other people were eating that looked good. Probably due to my poor Chinese communication skills she only took us to the dessert section, so our first round of dishes were primarily desserts, and durian desserts at that. We decided to take our chances with random dishes on the menu as well as some of their recommendations. We got some interesting dishes, all of which were quite good, though the kitchen reported that a few of what we ordered was out of stock. We did a couple more rounds of ordering 5 or so dishes and each time they came back saying 2-3 of them were no longer being served. Not only did we not know what we were ordering, but we didn’t know what we were getting or what was out of stock. After a frustrating, tasty but not satisfying breakfast, we decided to ask for one more order of shrimp shumai, a staple. About 30 minutes later our dish still hadn’t arrived and at that point we were all ready to just leave. As I was getting up to pay the bill, a woman ran over and placed a dish on our table. It looked like shrimp shumai but it had what looked like oysters on top, and instead of the usual four dumplings to a dish, this only had two dumplings. It was time to give up and get our day started. Even though it wasn’t the most relaxing and satisfying breakfast we all hoped for, it was definitely a good insight into how frustrating it can be to a foreigner in China and never know what’s going on or what food you’re about to eat.  <br><br>

			The rest of the trip went smoothly as we all began to tire out from traveling for two straight weeks (five straight weeks in my case) and took it easy in our last day in Shenzhen. The last day we went to Hong Kong and met up with Owen’s colleague from work who showed us around Hong Kong. We went to a fisherman’s island called Cheung Chau where we sampled different mochi, and watched the sunset. We also went to the top of the Peak for a final Chinese dinner. We finished out the trip by playing cards (a game called Mao that I taught everyone) in a bar in SoHo (yes there’s a SoHo in Hong Kong too). I think (hope) all my friends enjoyed the trip, regardless, Owen left with a couple oil paintings and a cast iron wok, so I’d say it was pretty successful. <br><br>

			That’s all for now, I’ve just started my second semester as an English teacher teaching the same students as last semester. They were pumped to have me back, but I'm beginning to feel ready for the next thing, whatever that may be. <br><br>

			Until next time! <br><br>
