		Hi all,

Writing this in early April I’m realizing how quickly my time here is moving. I’ve nearly been living in Shenzhen for 8 months, I only have 3 months left of teaching, and every night I go to sleep with the impending question of what should I do next swimming through my head. Last month I had more friends come visit me, and this month my sister Mic turns 20; so on the 28th everyone should wish her a warm welcome into post-teen life! I also went on a backpacking/camping trip in Hong Kong over a 3-day weekend with Will. Stay tuned for stories on all the above. <br><br>

Back in early March Will and I had the pleasure of taking our friend from college named Colin around Hong Kong for a weekend. He was coming to visit us with our other friend Brett, whose parents live in Wuhan, China. Before heading up to Wuhan however, he spent a weekend with us in Hong Kong. Getting to catch up with Colin after not seeing each other for nearly two years was surely a highlight, as was hiking around Lamma island, but I’ll always remember walking to our hostel from Central late at night trying to catch cabs unsuccessfully all the way home. It was two hours of pure frustration and excellent 3am exercise.<br><br> 

The following week flew by with the anticipation of taking a bullet train five hours North to see Colin, Brett, and his family and soon enough there I was in Wuhan. Wuhan is one of the biggest cities you probably have never heard of. It’s in central China and boasts a population of 12 million people. I only had from Friday night to Sunday afternoon to explore the city so I definitely didn’t get to see it all, but I had a great time just being with friends. We walked around a plum/cherry blossom park right as they were starting to bloom, sampled the Wuhan famous hot dry noodles, and explored a massive wholesale market where you could find anything, and thousands of them. I personally bought a couple pairs of boxers as I was running low and couldn’t resist the incredible deal. </p>

Brett and Colin then stayed with Will and me down in Shenzhen for the week while I was teaching. That Monday, they got to see me teach a class at school as well as perform in an English language festival. This past month my school has been hosting an English language month where every week there is a different event. The events range from entire-school assemblies in English, to English speaking competitions. Brett, Colin, and Will got to see me perform a poem (that the school wrote) with some of my students, and recently I also got to judge one of the English speaking competitions. Supposedly I’m also going to compete in a speaking competition in the upcoming weeks against the other teachers, though I don’t really understand why as I’m the only native English speaker. I just hope I don’t lose. I’ll report back on that in the next entry.<br><br>


In Shenzhen we took them to the standard spots (Electronics market, Baishizhou, Luohu fake goods mall, Dongmen walking street) as well as some things we hadn’t done before. One night we met up with a couple of our Chinese friends and went to a really cool jazz bar that they showed us. We followed up with more music and went to a massive building dedicated to ktv (karaoke). We got a room and spent the next couple hours trading between singing American and Chinese pop songs. I unfortunately had to taxi back home afterwards as I was teaching the next day, but they went off to get late night barbecue. It was a great last night in Shenzhen with friends, and I now have excellent blackmail material of my friends singing (screaming) Ariana Grande songs.<br><br> </p>

That weekend we traveled together to Guangzhou, a city I have been to many times now but conveniently a city that Brett grew up in during his middle school years. I gave him total control over the weekend as I’m sure he wanted to do some nostalgia-inducing activities. We did a nice mixture of old and new for me. We walked through an old medicine market with massive bags full of dried ingredients, and cages with all sorts of animals. We got foot massages, ate superb dim sum in a restaurant Brett used to go to, and walked around malls and arcades sipping bubble tea. My favorite night was when we sat in Zhen Zhu New Town overlooking the Canton Tower and wrote poems. During college my friends and I would host poetry nights where people would come over and for 30 minutes write poetry and we’d all share them after. None of us are poets, and most of them were intentionally comedic. We decided to do a poetry night in Guangzhou and it was awesome. Here’s a poem Brett wrote that I think is worth sharing.<br><br>

Hainan Chicken Rice<br><br>



Though a sterile concrete jungle<br>

I wouldn't visit twice or thrice<br>

Each day I thank thee, Singapore<br>

For Hainan chicken rice<br><br>



Boiled in broth with ginger and onion<br>

Until meat is tender and juicy white<br>

Supple flesh to be slurped off the bone<br>

O, delicious chicken rice<br><br>



A coarse paste of garlic, ginger, oil <br>

Adorns fatty skin and tastes so nice<br>

A contrast of subtle and strong flavors<br>

O, fantastic chicken rice<br><br>



Whether Michelin stars count one, two or more<br>

A meal out with you will forever suffice<br>

Last time I cooked you at home I got salmonella<br>

O, difficult chicken rice<br><br>



So simple, so dainty yet so delicious<br>

Should be easy to just boil a freaking chicken right?<br>

If you want to be hungry for three hours then immediately get salmonella<br>

Try cooking chicken rice<br><br>



I should have bought health insurance.<br>

It's just that I'm socially liberal and fiscally conservative, aiite?<br>

Next thing I've contracted a mid-15th century disease<br>

From hainan chicken rice<br><br>



Dear god I ate every last bit of that chicken<br>

I'm crying and sweating and puking all night<br>

I'm in the hospital, paying in cash for salmonella<br>

Induced by Hainan chicken rice<br><br>



And as I lay here in my diarrhea stained death bed<br>

My family's bank accounts bare with strife<br>

I smile as I order my last meal on earth<br>

Fajitas!<br><br>

Saying goodbye to my friends was tough, but it was quickly followed up by a 3-day weekend trip to Hong Kong with Will. China just celebrated Qingming festival, or tomb sweeping day, which is a day for people to honor the dead. All schools got the Friday off and we decided to take the opportunity to camp in the Hong Kong New Territories, an area largely uninhabited and protected by the government so that people can’t build on the land. Needless to say it’s full of forest, mountain, and beach, all natural things things that you don’t see very often in such proximity to major metropolises.<br><br>

To prepare for the trip we ordered a tent on Taobao, and although we thought we ordered a 2-person tent, it turned out to be for 1 person. Either we had read the listing incorrectly, or Taobao had deceived us! We packed up our bags for the weekend, everything from clothes to our tent to water and food. We didn’t have big enough backpacks to fit enough supplies for 3 days of camping and hiking, so we decided to create a route that centered around a beach campsite with food and water. <br><br>

On our first day after I got off from school, we caught the subway into Hong Kong, ate a late lunch, and filled the space we had left in our bags with 7 Eleven snacks. We caught a series of three subsequent buses and right as the sun was setting we found ourselves standing in front of our first campsite. We had gotten off the bus and walked through the woods a bit and when we found it there was a big sign that said it was closed! Our trip was off to a good start. Luckily Will had a phone with a data plan and so we looked around the map for the nearest campsite. We walked back up to the road and waited for another to bus to come and take us a few more stops to the new site. This new site was right on the side of the road and by the time we got there and set up camp, it was pitch black. We were the only ones sleeping there that night so we were able to use our flashlights and talk. After pitching our single person tent we sat on a bench and ate most of our snacks for dinner and talked for a couple hours before heading to bed. However, I began feeling itchy all over my body so I got up from the bench and turned my phone’s flashlight on. The entire bench was swarming with ants, specifically around the spot where I left my sandwich wrapper. We threw out the wrapper, and I took some time to rid the ants from my body. It was definitely a good lesson in camping; clean up immediately after eating in the wild.<br><br> </p>

We woke up early the next morning, mostly because of the poor sleeping conditions. We slept on the hard ground with no room for movement in the tent. We began our hike to the next campsite and within 10 seconds of starting on the trail, a huge snake slid across the path in front of us. Off to a good start. We hiked steep inclines for about four hours on limited supplies (the ants had gotten into my water bottle as well) until we came to a small village on a beach with a cafe. We bought more water, ate some much needed food, and hiked a bit more to a remote beach village; our second campsite. We rested for a couple hours there and started talking with a Chinese tour group from Shenzhen who were all petroleum engineers. There was a 4-year old boy (not a petroleum engineer yet but rather one of their sons) who kept shooting Will and me with a plastic bottle masquerading as a rifle. I faked my death maybe 100 times that evening just to appease him. More and more people came to the beach so Will and I decided to hike a bit further on to an even more remote beach and setup camp there. When we reached the beach, we were warmly welcomed by a herd of cows basking in the Spring sun. I guess it really was remote. We ate dinner at the campsite, walked around the beach at night, and sustained no fewer than 50 mosquito bites before heading to bed. </p>

The next day we packed up and did another grueling couple hours of pure uphill hiking until we reached a road with a bus stop. Along the way however I ran into two of my 5th grade students! I actually didn’t recognize them and was mostly focusing on just making it up this mountain, but they shouted my name as they passed us walking down. I stopped and traded a few words with them before we went our separate ways. The following week in school in their class though everyone had heard that I had seen a couple students while hiking and everyone wanted to know what I was doing there. News travels fast when you’re 10 years old I guess. We then took a bus to a town called Sai Kung so that we could get lunch and restock our supplies. At the restaurant we ate at, the owner’s mother came out and sat with us for a couple hours. It was nice to hear her perspective on the future of China and Hong Kong.<br><br>

She walked us to a grocery store where we bought 12 slices of salami, a container of tomatoes, and some salt & pepper crackers for dinner, and a bag of muesli for breakfast. We said goodbye to her and began our ascent to our last campsite of the trip. Luckily for us the next campsite was on top of a mountain, about 2 hours of stairs away. We were already pretty worn out from not sleeping well and hiking all day on low amounts of food, but we managed to make it all the way up and were rewarded with the best view of the trip. We ate our dinner overlooking Sai Kung and the bay, made sure not to feed any ants, waved at all the cows, and pitched our tent for the lat time. That night we shared the space with a Hong Kong middle school group, who kept us up all night with their screaming and woke us up early with it too.<br><br>

We let out our frustrations by passively saying nothing to them and on Sunday morning left for home. The way back was short as we just had to hike down the other side of the mountain and find a metro stop that would take us back to Shenzhen. However, we took a wrong path on the way down and basically walked down an extremely tight goat path (I think?). Our legs were getting scraped by brambles with every step and we ran into a group of older hikers who gifted us with grapes, an orange, and a photoshoot. Eventually we made it to a subway, and subsequently Shenzhen, and I took a much needed shower and sleep.<br><br>

In other news I am beginning to plan my next moves! I only have a few months left of teaching in China, but before coming home I still want to do some more traveling. My plan as of now is to take a few months to travel as much of Japan as I can! I had a really great time when I went with my friends back in February, but I felt as if the country had so much more to explore.<br><br>

I haven’t bought any flights yet, but I am currently planning on being in Japan from late July until my money runs out. If you or anyone you know wants to travel with me in Japan, or already lives in Japan, please let me know! Especially if you know anyone that lives in Japan and would be willing to host me! <br><br>

That’s all for now; I’m looking forward to hearing back from you all, and don’t forget to send a Happy Birthday wish to my sister on April 28th!<br><br>

Great,<br><br>

Baigs<br><br>

TLDR; My friends Brett and Colin came to visit. We went to Guangzhou and wrote some poetry. Will and I went hiking and I learned what nature was. I’m planning on traveling to Japan for some months starting in late July so please send me recommendations and/or contacts of people you know that live there! ~Thanks<br>
